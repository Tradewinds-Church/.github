# Snippits of code deployed at Tradewinds Church

These repositories contain code used to support/automate some administrative functions.

These were authored by ted@tradewinds.church with help from Copilot AI.

I have very basic programing skills... As such these scripts have minimal error checking and should be considered as alpha versions that have worked under a limited set of controlled conditions. There's no obligation to support this but if the notion grabs you feel free to revise or replace. 

By reviewing the code and comments, if and when it does break, one might understand the task it was trying to accomplish.
